# 🧪 Machine Learning, small exercise: Jet clustering, unsupervised learning

In this small project you will get a hands-on authentic introduction to unsupervised learning by applying it to a problem from high energy particle physics: jet clustering!

The project is outlined in the notebook `jet-exercise.ipynb`, which you should open as a notebook. Finish the code in the notebook, use it to answer the questions, using the simulated data in the two files `pythia.dat` and `pythia-large.dat`. These simulations are generated with the high energy physics Monte Carlo PYTHIA (see [https://www.pythia.org](https://www.pythia.org)). For completeness, the PYTHIA program used to generate the files is located in `mainWriteParticles.cc`, but it is beyond the scope of the exercises.
