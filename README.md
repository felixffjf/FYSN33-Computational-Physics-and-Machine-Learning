# Entropic Spring — Rediscover Hooke’s Law with Monte Carlo

Welcome to the **Applied Computational Physics project**:  
*Entropic Spring – Rediscover Hooke’s Law with Monte Carlo.*

In this project, you will build a simple one-dimensional simulation of a rubber band using Monte Carlo methods.  
You will explore microstates, entropy, reweighting, and direct sampling — and show how Hooke’s law emerges from statistical physics.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Clone this repository**
Clone the repository and make a feature branch to work off of.
   ```
   # bash
   git clone git@gitlab.com:comp-phys-ai/projects/entropic-spring-rediscover-hooke-s-law-with-monte-carlo.git my-working-directory
   cd my-working-directory/
   git checkout -b my-awesome-solution-branch
   ```
2. **Read the assignment**
The full project description (including all theory, tasks, and instructions) is in
`assignment.pdf`. It contains everything you need — there is **no template code or external data** provided.

3. **Work locally**
Implement your solution in Python (or Python and C++ if you choose the stretch goal).
Keep your code and documentation organized within this repository.

4. **Hand in your work**
When finished, create a merge request in GitLab with:

   a. Your code and plots

   b. A documentation (`.md` files in the repo) or pdf-report describing your approach and results

   c. (Optional) any stretch goals you completed

## 🧩 Notes

The project is self-contained; all equations, hints, and expected outputs are in the assignment PDF.

You may use your own structure for organizing code (e.g. `src/`, `figures/`, etc.), but keep it clean and documented.

Use a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
